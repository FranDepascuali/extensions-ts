# ts-extensions
Contemplative and deep exploration of extending entities in TypeScript, inspired by Swift-like extensions.

Read about extensions here: [Introducing extensions to TypeScript](https://depa-thoughts.vercel.app/extensions-typescript/).

## Usage

To use a specific function from `ts-extensions`, directly import the extension you need from its file:

```ts
import { Arrays } from 'ts-extensions/src/arrays';

const uniqueItems = Arrays.withoutDuplicates([1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5]);
console.log(uniqueItems); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

## Overview
`ts-extensions` is a TypeScript library offering a collection of functions designed extend other entities. Inspired by Swift-like extensions, this library aims to provide elegant approaches to solving common programming problems in TypeScript.

## Installation
Install the package using npm:
```bash
npm install ts-extensions
```

## Tests

To run the tests for `ts-extensions`, follow these steps:

```bash
npm install
npm run test
```

## Rationale
The general guidelines for extending an entity are:
1. Extensions should be placed in their own file, typically `<entity>.extension.ts`, although this can vary at the implementerâ€™s discretion. (e.g., `Array.extension.ts`)
2. Extensions are inherently linked to the existence of the entity they extend (without embodying an entity themselves).
3. An entity should be represented by a type from the type system.
4. Extensions are named as the pluralized version of the entity extended.
5. Extensions always receive the extended entity as their first parameter, along with any additional parameters.
6. Extensions should call upon other extensions when appropriate, emphasizing behaviors as extensions wherever feasible.
7. Extensions should be pure, ensuring that every function is a transformation without side effects.
8. Extensions can utilize properties or functions previously defined in the entity they extend.

These guidelines ensure that extensions are self-contained, isolated, shareable, and testable by definition.

While ts-extensions provides extensions themselves, the main goal of this repository is to inspire developers to embrace and extend their own entities (as an alternative to OOP-based solutions).
